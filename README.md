# RPS

## Background 
RPS is an implementation of the popular hand-game, Rock; Paper; Scissors. Utilizing motion capture and image recognition technology, the player’s moves will be delivered via their camera; once the move has been recognized, it will be compared to the computer’s and a point will be awarded to the winner. 

## Functionality & MVPs

#### In *RPS*, users will be able to: 
* track their hand movements with a handpose recognition AI
* input three different gestures, via their camera 
* play a game of rock, paper, scissors with a computer player, whose moves will appear in an on-screen animation
* choose between a single match, best out of three, and best out of five format
* pause the game between rounds
* see the flow of the game and their choices in an end of game round-up

#### In addition, this project will include: 
* modular instructions 
* exciting background music
